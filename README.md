# Elite Log Agent

A windows utility written in C#, parsing Elite: Dangerous log and feeding it to various sites
Allows updating data on external sites (like Inara or EDSM) in near-real-time as the log gets updated

**Does not require Elite login/password - only the 3rd party API keys**

Currently in beta stage

## Quickstart: how to use

* Download [latest version][clickonce]
* Input commander name, Inara and EDSM API keys
* Click 'verify' under each key to check info is correct
* Save settings (apply and/or OK)
* (optional) Upload last 5 logs using corresponding button
* launch the game.

## Current Features

* EDSM (practically all log events)
* Inara (balance, travel, materials, engineer progress)

## Planned features

* **Support for EDDB/EDDN data feeds**
* Support for [Canonn API v2](https://github.com/derrickmehaffy/CAPI-V2)
* Google sheets for Powerplay/BGS

## Get latest version

* ClickOnce application installer [here][clickonce]
* Latest (pre-)release merged .exe [here][releases]

## Plugin development

The code base has not yet reached maturity, so any (even ostensibly public) APIs might change. Hence, at this time, I see the best way of plugin support as incorporating them into this codebase. This will most likely change once a stable version is reached.
To contribute to development, please fork the repository

## SDLC

Builds are done in AppVeyor. `master` branch is the primary integration branch ('potentially releasable').
GitHub pre-releases are published from `master`
Releasing to ClickOnce installer is done via merging to `prod` branch
